## FAQ
> What is open99?  
  **open99 is Windows99's open-source base. It is a free and open-source Web OS maintained and led by System41.**  

> What is open99-apps?  
  **open99-apps contains the source code for preinstalled applications on open99 & other forks of open99. It was previously located in the `system/applications` directory in the main repo. However, the System41 team wants to maintain a distant relationship between the open99 system and its app code.**  
  
> How is open99 different from Windows99?  
  **open99 provides the vast majority of the code for System41's Windows99 project. Windows99 is a closed-source project almost identical to open99. It can be accessed at [this URL](//windows99.vercel.app)**  
  
> Why is this project small/empty?  
  **open99 is currently empty until Windows99's first release. This is because Windows99 started before open99, and for reasons having to do with synchronizing open99 with Windows99, since most of open99's code will come from Windows99 during the initial commit. This will not ever happen again after the initial commit**  
  
> When will open99 be released/When will Windows99's first release be released?  
  **The release date is TBD. open99 and Windows99 take a lot of time to develop.**
